## 🆕 **Latest Major Update: Census Data Intelligence System**

### **🧠 Revolutionary Census Data Understanding**
- ✅ **Intelligent Dataset Selection**: Automatically recommends the best Census datasets based on your analysis type, geography level, and time requirements
- ✅ **Relationship Mapping**: Maps relationships between different Census surveys (Decennial, ACS 1-year/5-year, Economic Census, Population Estimates)
- ✅ **Quality Guidance**: Provides methodology notes, quality checks, and reporting considerations
- ✅ **Pitfall Prevention**: Helps avoid common mistakes like using incompatible datasets or ignoring margins of error
- ✅ **Human-Readable**: Transforms complex Census data selection into simple, intelligent recommendations

**Example Usage**:
```python
from siege_utilities.geo import select_census_datasets

# Get recommendations for demographic analysis at tract level
recommendations = select_census_datasets(
    analysis_type="demographics",
    geography_level="tract",
    variables=["population", "income", "education"]
)

# System automatically recommends ACS 5-Year Estimates (2020)
# because it provides stable, detailed data at tract level
primary_dataset = recommendations["primary_recommendation"]["dataset"]
print(f"Use {primary_dataset} for your analysis")
```

## 📊 **Built-in Sample Datasets**

### **Realistic Data for Testing and Development**
- ✅ **Census-based Samples**: Real boundaries with synthetic population data
- ✅ **Synthetic Generation**: Customizable demographics, businesses, and housing
- ✅ **Privacy Safe**: No real personal information, perfect for development
- ✅ **Multiple Scales**: Tract, county, and metropolitan area samples

**Sample Data Usage**:
```python
from siege_utilities.data import load_sample_data, generate_synthetic_population

# Load pre-built samples
tract_data = load_sample_data("census_tract_sample", population_size=1000)
county_data = load_sample_data("census_county_sample", tract_count=5)

# Generate custom synthetic data
population = generate_synthetic_population(
    demographics={"Hispanic or Latino": 0.35, "White alone, not Hispanic or Latino": 0.30, "Asian alone, not Hispanic or Latino": 0.25, "Black or African American alone, not Hispanic or Latino": 0.10},
    size=500,
    include_names=True,
    include_income=True
)

# Perfect for testing functions without external dependencies
from siege_utilities import get_row_count, sanitise_dataframe_column_names
print(f"Population count: {get_row_count(population)}")
clean_df = sanitise_dataframe_column_names(population)
```
